					Hello! My name is Youstina Ibrahim. I was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt, and I moved to the United States of America in
					2012. In 2017, I completed my associate degree at Northern Virginia Community College in Information Technology. In September
of the same year, I started my bachelor’s degree at The George Washington University in Cybersecurity, and I expect to Graduate
at the end of 2019. During my journey at NOVA, I took classes that concentrate at the Information Technology in general,
like Java, C++, Database, Software Design, but at GWU I start concentrating more on the Cybersecurity world and how it works.
I took classes like Data Communication, Ethics & Law, Compliance and Risk Management, Network Security, Securing Operating
System, and Cyber Investigation. I speak fluent English and Arabic and know a little bit of French, and I’m still
learning.				</p>
